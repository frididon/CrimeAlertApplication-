### IMPORTANT:

For projects with Firestore integration, you must first run the following commands to ensure the project compiles:

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
<sub> These commands will create a bulid folder for the flutter applications to run. </sub>


```
After build is created , use web/application launch to access reports database , by selecting web button , work in progress.
